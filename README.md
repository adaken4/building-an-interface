# Building an Interface


## Project Overview
This project involves designing and prototyping an e-commerce app for second-hand electronic devices. The goal is to create an engaging user interface (UI) while adhering to design principles like atomic design, consistency, and desirability testing.

The project is divided into several key phases:
1. **Styleguide** - Creating a moodboard with typography, color palette, and examples of UI elements.
2. **Design System** - Developing a library of reusable components organized into atoms, molecules, and organisms with multistates.
3. **High-Fidelity Screens** - Designing detailed screens based on wireframes and the design system.
4. **Animation** - Adding interactivity and animations to screens.
5. **Desirability Testing** - Evaluating the emotional response of users to the design and refining it based on feedback.
